Hello and welcome to my portfolio website! My name is Oliver Wu, and I am currently a Computer Science student at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Thank you for taking the time to visit my website and learn more about my skills, work experience, and projects.

## About Me

I am passionate about computer science and technology and am always looking for ways to expand my knowledge and skill set. Throughout my academic and professional career, I have gained experience in a variety of programming languages and tools, including C++, Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Azure Cloud, AWS, MongoDB, MySQL, and Git.

## Education

I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, and my coursework has included classes in Data Structures and Algorithms, Information Systems, Discrete Mathematics, Applied Linear Algebra, Computer Organization, and Applications of Computer Science Theory. 

## Work Experience

I have had the opportunity to work as a Junior Software Engineer and Software Engineering Intern at Boncor Medical LLC, where I have gained valuable experience in database integration, algorithm development, and Azure Web Services. Additionally, I have worked as a Data Management Intern at the Association of Chinese Americans, where I designed and delivered an interactive website and performed data management tasks.

## Projects

One of my most significant projects to date has been the development of an Academic Games Webapp, which I created using C++, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, MySQL, and AWS. The app is designed to host academic game practices and tournaments and promote creative, higher-order thinking in students during the COVID-19 pandemic. The program is currently in official tournament use by over 500 students.

## Leadership Roles

As the Public Relations Chair for the Vietnamese Student Association, I have worked to promote Vietnamese culture and inclusivity within the student body. I have also connected with other organizations to collaborate on events while diversifying and unifying the membership body.
